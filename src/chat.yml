#Anything under listen is what the bot looks for in a chat message
#Jack works from the top down, so if a player types "How do i vote and do you have discord?" he will respond to Vote,
# because vote is higher on the listen list. He won't respond to both.

listen:
  "vote": _vote
  "voting": _vote
  "discord": _discord
  "voice chat": _discord

#All answers must be in list form, and Jack will choose a random one from that list, if you only have one item in the
# list, that is the only one it will display

answers:
  _vote:
  - "Our voting websites are: cool.com"
  _discord:
  - "You can join our discord server here: discord.com"
  - "Yes we have discord! Here's the link: blah.com"
